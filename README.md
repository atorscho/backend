# Laravel Backend Package
This a fully autonomous backend package for all your Laravel projects.

It contains the most basic features, such as: user and group management, custom fields, custom content (posts, articles, pages etc) and various plugins.

I recommend you to start with the [Wiki](https://github.com/atorscho/backend/wiki).
